# System 2: The sensor

## Descpription
Collecting data from usersâ€™ steps as the input, with different steps on the sensor, means the hustle state of the current scenario. It can be placed anywhere to capture hustle data.

## Materials and resources

! The below listing and steps are for 1 sensor ONLY, please adjust the quantity

### Laser cut 
![alt text](./resources/laser-cut.jpg "System 2 Laser cut schematic")

Material: **3mm MDF board**
File: [download](./resources/Input.ai)

### Steps to assemble
1. Apply copper tape on the inner side of sensor plate, solder the connection points of the tapes to make sure they are all connected ![](./resources/IMG_1716.jpeg)
2. Cut out the velostat to fit the slot (_stack up the velostat may enhance the sensitivity_)
3. Put the velostat in the middle of the conductive layer
5. Wire up the system
6. Test the system by deploying the code and controls as below

## Wiring
![alt text](./resources/wiring.png "Wiring for system 1")
| pin (ESP 82866) | Connection |
| --- | ---------- |
| A0 | Any point of the live wire of the system |
| 3.3V |  One side of the conductive layer |
| GND | Another side of the conductive layer |

## Software

### Way to determine status
| Status | payload msg | Description | Rules |
| ------ | ----------- | ----------- | ----- |
| A step is detected| `pressed` | User walked a step on the sensor plate (aka a force is applied on the sensor) | by comparing the the `sensorValue` with the `pastSensorValue`, if the difference is greater than `sensitivty`, a signal will be emitted
| Standing | `stopped` | User is standing on the sensor plate | the `sensorValue` !== `refValue` and remain in a buffer range for more than 5s
| Idle | `empty` | No user is on the sensor plate | the `sensorValue` == `refValue` for more than 5s


For details, please reference to the comments in [sys2.ino](sys2/sys2.ino). For the first time deploy, please be remained to update the Wifi connection, Device ID and MQTT broker endpoint.
### Controls (Emitting)

The system will emit differnt type of payload based on the sensors' status on the topic `{device_id}/status`
#### Standing example
```JSON
{
    "id": "sys2_1",
    "msg": "stopped",
    "standingCounter": 6618 
}
```
#### Pressed example
```JSON
{
    "id": "sys2_1",
    "msg": "pressed",
    "delta": 1011,
    "sinceSys": 10012602
}
```
#### Idle example
```JSON
{
    "id": "sys2_1",
    "msg": "empty",
    "emptyCounter": 6655  
}
```
